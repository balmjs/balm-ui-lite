## Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

### Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.

__Verify that__

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

### Then install the [Balm CLI](https://github.com/balmjs/balm-cli) globally.

```sh
npm install -g balm-cli

balm -V
```
